# FUTURE READY TALENT PROJECT
This is my final project for the future ready talent.

This is a life style project. 

In this I have created a website called yummy blog in which you can see some simple recipes and what is best food at a particular place.

This web site is in two languages one is english and other one is latin, the headings are in english and the info is in latin.

I have used microsoft azure "static web apps" to deploy my website.

Here is the link to website:https://kind-moss-02fcf9810.1.azurestaticapps.net
